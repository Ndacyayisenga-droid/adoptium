The [Eclipse Adoptium Project Management Committee (PMC)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium/who)
meets weekly to ensure that the projects under the Adoptium Top Level Project are operating
efficiently, obstacles are removed, plan are shared widely, conflicts are avoided or resolved,
and so on.  A full description of the role of the PMC can be found in [Eclipsepedia](https://wiki.eclipse.org/PMC).

The PMC has a technical focus, and works in conjunction with the
[Adoptium Working Group](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/adoptium-charter.php), committers,
contributors, and users to serve the needs of the project. The PMC's scope is described in [the
Adoptium Project charter](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium/charter).

Minutes of the PMC meeting are taken at the time, and approved at the following meeting as being
an accurate reflection of the discussions that were held. The approved minutes are published here to
provide openness and transparency.
