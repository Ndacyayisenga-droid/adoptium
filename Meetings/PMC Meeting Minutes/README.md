The Eclipse Adoptium Project Management Committee (PMC) meets weekly to ensure that the projects
under the Adoptium Top Level Project are operating efficiently, obstacles are removed, plan are
shared widely, conflicts are avoided or resolved, and so on.  A full description of the role of
the PMC can be found in [Eclipsepedia](https://wiki.eclipse.org/PMC).

The PMC has a technical focus, and works in conjunction with the Adoptium Working Group, committers,
contributors, and users to serve the needs of the project. The PMC's scope is described in [the
Adoptium Project charter](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium/charter).

Minutes of the PMC meeting are taken at the time, and approved at the following meeting as being
an accurate reflection of the discussions that were held. The minutes are published here to
provide openness and transparency.
