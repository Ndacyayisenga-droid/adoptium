  - [ ] Iterating over the actions from the previous retrospective issue, ticking off completed items.
  - [ ] Iterate over the agenda, ensuring everything gets debated.
  - [ ] Create a clear list of actions at the end of the retrospective, including volunteer names.
- [ ] Create a new retrospective issue for the next release.
- [ ] Set yourself a calendar reminder so that you remember to commence step 1 (in the new issue) just before the next release.
