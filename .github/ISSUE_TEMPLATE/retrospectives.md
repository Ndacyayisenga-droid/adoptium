- [ ] Announce the retrospective Slack call's date + time on \#Release at least one full week in advance, and send out meeting invites.
- [ ] Host the slack call for the retrospective, including:
  - [ ] Iterating over the actions from the previous retrospective issue, ticking off completed items.
  - [ ] Iterate over the agenda, ensuring everything gets debated.
  - [ ] Create a clear list of actions at the end of the retrospective, including volunteer names.
- [ ] Create a new retrospective issue for the next release.
- [ ] Copy the \"Next Retrospective\" Google document into the relevant subfolder and rename it appropriately.
- [ ] Empty the Retrospective_Next Google document (except for the actions, which should be starred), and change the month at the top to the next release month.
- [ ] Set yourself a calendar reminder so that you remember to commence step 1 (in the new issue) just before the next release.
- [ ] Close this issue.
